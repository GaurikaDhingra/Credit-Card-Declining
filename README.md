# Credit Card Transaction Analysis & Decline Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes customer transaction patterns, focusing on declined transactions. The goal is to identify key trends and segment customers based on spending behavior using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering
- Insights into declined transactions
- Future scope: Predicting transaction declines using ML models

## Dataset
- Features:
  - Transaction amount
  - Merchant category
  - Customer ID
  - Decline reason
  - (Add relevant columns)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Insights
- Customers with frequent declines often belong to certain clusters.
- Transaction patterns reveal high-risk categories.
- K-Means clustering effectively segments users.

## Future Improvements
- Implement classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Feature engineering for better insights
- Build an interactive dashboard
